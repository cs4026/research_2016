˛˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˜˘With undergraduate fees tightly regulated 

and European Union 
recruitment at risk, 

where might univer-
sities be able to increase their income? One opportunity sug
-gested by The Complete 
University Guide™s survey 
of fees for the 2016-17 academic year is domes
-tic recruitment to taught 
postgraduate courses. 
The average fee for 
home taught postgradu
-ates in 2016-17 is £6,486. This is a 9.6
 per cent rise since 2015-16, 
and the ˜gure is growing 
signi˜cantly more rapidly than most other fee cat-egories. This is perhaps 
related to the fact that income- contingent loans 
of up to £10,000 are being introduced this 
autumn for home and EU master™s students, with 
institutions taking the opportunity to raise their 
fees towards that sum.
However, the fee levels 
remain signi˜cantly below 
the cost of running a 
master™s course, esti
-mated to average 
£11,315 by a study pub
-lished in 2014 by the 
Higher Education Council 
for England. Rosemary 
Deem, vice-principal for 
education at Royal Hollo
-way, University of London 
and chair of the UK Council for Graduate Edu-cation, says that there is 
ﬁincreasing concern that 
master™s courses at Eng
-lish universities are being 
subsidised by under
-graduate teachingﬂ 
because the average cost 
of a master™s remains 
below the £9,000 under
-graduate fee.
ﬁMaster™s courses are 
quite expensive to run, 
especially if they don™t 

have many students, 
because you need your 
best staff teaching their own research. People are 
starting to look at mas
-ter™s fees and they are 

thinking that they need 
to put them up,ﬂ Deem 
says. And she suspects 
that the introduction of the loans ﬁencourages 
people in institutions to think they can afford to 

put fees up by a bit more 
than they might otherwise 
have doneﬂ. 
Looking behind the 
average rise, some institu
-tions have increased their 
home postgraduate taught 
fees towards £10,000 at 
a particularly signi˜cant 
rate. For instance, the 
University of Bolton has 
increased its typical fee 
from £5,400 in 2015-16 
to £9,000 in 2016-17, 
a rise of 66.7 per cent, 
while the University of 
Leicester imposed a 
37.1 per cent rise, from 
£5,470 to £7,500.Paul Wakeling, senior 
lecturer in the depart
-
ment of education at the University of York, says 
that the full impact of postgraduate loans is yet 

to emerge. ﬁThere are 
a few institutions that 
seem to have gone up 
much more towards the 
undergraduate fee, but 
in general, the average 
fee increase, while it is 

well beyond in˚ation, 
is not a leap straight up to £10,000. There is 
 a lot of uncertainty at the 
moment, so that may lead 
people to hedge their 
bets a little,ﬂ he says.
Wakeling also high
-lights signi˜cant variation 
in domestic taught post-graduate fees, with the 
highest prices tending to 
be concentrated in the 
golden triangle of London, 
Oxford and Cambridge. 
ﬁIf people were following 
their ˜nancial interests, 
they would be going to 
some of those more pro-
vincial universities,ﬂ he 
says. ﬁFees at Birming
-ham, Shef˜eld, Leeds and 
Newcastle are quite a bit 
lower than in 
 London.ﬂ

Data are based on a survey conducted by 

The Complete Univer-
sity Guide. The survey 

results have been 
published annually since 2002, when 
Mike Reddin ˜rst 

presented them.Institutions were 
asked to provide a typ
-ical fee, although some 
chose to provide a range. 
Figures are for guidance 
only. Fees for speci˜c 
courses may vary from 
those shown. The aver
-ages exclude institutions 
that provided a range.
A dash (Œ) indicates that a ˜gure was not supplied or that the uni-versity does not run the 
course. Universities pro
-viding no data have 
been omitted. A small 
number of ˜gures have 
been added by 
Times Higher Education using ˜gures from universities™ 
websites.
In Wales in 2016-17, 
Welsh-domiciled under
-graduates will be 

charged £3,900 a year 
wherever they study in 
the UK. Undergraduates 
domiciled in Northern 
Ireland will pay £3,925 
a year if they study 
there, but will pay up 
to £9,000 if they study 
elsewhere in the UK. 
Scottish undergraduates 
will pay no tuition fees 
in Scotland, but up to 
£9,000 elsewhere in 
the UK.050001000015000
